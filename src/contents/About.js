            <p>I've always had a big passion for all things digital. I'm quite new to the field as a professional 
                but I like to think about myself
                as a quick learner, and I'm always eager to learn more.
                 I'm currently studying for a bachelor's degree in <b>Energy and Environmental Engineering</b>, but a switch 
                to <b>Information Technology</b> studies has been planned for the fall of 2021. I have project based experience
                in both frontend and backend development technologies with a focus on Web Development.

                In my spare time I like to code, ride motorcycles, drive cars and spend time with my friends and family.
